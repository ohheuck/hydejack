LEGO COLOR SORTER

Prof : Jong-Han Kim   
Major : Department of Electronic Engineering   
Producer1 : Oh-Heuck Kwon   
Producer2 : Min-He Kim   
Production period : 2nd semester of 2020   

A brief introduction : We have created a machine that categorizes Lego by color and counts how many colors each have. The color sensor recognizes the color of the Lego as it passes the conveyor belt, and then counts it on the LCD monitor. After 1900 microseconds of detection, the servo motor at the end of the conveyor belt rotates left or right depending on the color and classifies the same color. We made it based on the Arduino we learned in class. And the conveyor belt is made from 3D printing.



## Embedded system design
I'm going to take a class in the third grade.
